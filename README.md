_Our submission to HobbyHacks 2020 under the game and music categories_

Inspired by auto-scroll games like Mario, Flappy Bird, and Geometry Dash, our game is unique in that it integrates music into its controls. 
You're at a concert (with your instrument of choice, of course) when suddenly, it starts pouring concrete! By some miracle, there's no concrete on you. Alas, everyone else is stuck, including the musicians. But the show must go on! To save the musicians, play C, D, and E to move forwards, backwards, and jump, all while playing the notes on each musician to break them out of their predicament. Be careful, though--if you wait too long, the concrete will harden and the musician will be trapped forever :(
