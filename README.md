# BREAKING NOTES

_Our submission to HobbyHacks 2020 under the game and music categories_

Inspired by auto-scroll games by Mario, Flappy Bird, and Geometry Dash, our game integrates music into into its controls. Imagine this situation: you're at a concert (with your instrument of choice, of course) when suddenly, it starts pouring concrete! By some miracle, there's no concrete on you. Alas, everyone else is stuck, including the musicians. But, the show must go on! To save the musicians, play notes to control your movements, all while playing the notes on each musician to break them out of their predicament. Be careful, though--if you wait too long, the concrete will harden and the musician will be trapped forever :(
